## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="A Nix-wrapped Mojo" icon="nix">
        Mojo wrapped in [Nix](https://nixos.org/). No implicit `apt`
        installations, no need to use Ubuntu. You can use `rules_mojo` on any
        `x86_64-linux` system that has Nix installed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Reproducible, Hermetic builds" icon="seti:bazel">
        [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) rules for Mojo. This means that
        `rules_mojo` gives you incremental builds. In `rules_mojo`s own CI this
        reduces build times and CPU cycles spent by up to 95%.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Built for scale" icon="seti:bicep">
        Integration with [NativeLink](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink)
        and [Local Remote Execution (LRE)](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/tree/main/local-remote-execution)
        which lets you execute builds in arbitrarily scalable Kubernetes
        clusters. Whether you want to build on 1000 cores or run executables on
        edge networks across the world, the NativeLink+LRE infrastructure
        supports it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Blazingly fast toolchains" icon="rocket">
        A bundled Clang/LLVM C++ toolchain with the
        [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold) linker and
        [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), the Rust rewrite of
        coreutils. This toolchain links Mojo executables up to two orders of
        magnitude faster than a standard C++ toolchain.
